# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fix: LANG command handler no longer references undefined `MESSAGES`; now validates against the preloaded locale list.
- Docs: Clarify i18n availability â€” only `en` is built-in; `it` is provided under `examples/config/messages.it.json` with copy instructions.

## 1.0.0

- First stable release: unified structure, only modern API and CLI, no legacy or standalone code.
- Entry point: `src/main.js`.
- All library files are now in `src/`.
- Documentation and structure simplified.
